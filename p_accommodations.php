					<p>The Main House at Aldebaran sleeps up to 12 people in casual comfort. Downstairs there are three sleeping rooms: the master bedrooom, which has a queen bed, a fireplace, and direct entry to the downstairs bathroom; the front bedroom, with a queen bed and a sunny front view; and an airy screened-in sleeping porch with a single bed. Also downstairs are a fully equipped kitchen, a large bathroom (accessible from the kitchen as well as from the master bedroom), and the main room, which has a stone fireplace and a huge oak table that seats ten comfortably for dinner.</p>

					<p>Upstairs there are two more bedrooms: The front bedroom has a double bed plus a single. The rear bedroom has a queen and a single. There's also a second spacious bathroom and a large loft area with a single bed and long cushioned benches.  Children love to spend the night here in their sleeping bags.</p>

					<p>The house is equipped with dishwasher, microwave, and barbecue grills (please supply your own charcoal); local phone service and wireless Internet are provided.  The house is not air conditioned, but usually cool; several box fans are available for the rare hot night. There is no broadcast TV reception in the valley, but we do have a TV set and DVD/VHS player so you can watch movies if you bring them.</p>
